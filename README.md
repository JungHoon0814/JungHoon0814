# JungHoon Kim (PLime) | Frontend Developer with Full-Stack Experience üöÄ

Hi, I'm JungHoon, a developer passionate about creating exceptional user experiences through frontend development, while leveraging my full-stack capabilities gained from startup experience.

Currently working at a startup, I wear multiple hats - from crafting pixel-perfect UIs to architecting backend solutions and managing infrastructure. This diverse experience has taught me to see the bigger picture while maintaining a deep focus on frontend excellence.

### What Drives Me
- I transform complex problems into elegant, user-friendly solutions
- I believe in understanding the 'why' behind every technical decision
- I'm not afraid to dive into new territories, whether it's infrastructure or design
- I continuously bridge the gap between design, development, and business needs

### My Current Role
As a full-stack developer in a startup environment, I handle:
- Frontend Development: Building responsive and intuitive user interfaces
- Backend Architecture: Designing and implementing scalable server solutions
- Infrastructure Management: Ensuring robust and efficient system operations
- Product Planning: Contributing to strategic decisions and feature roadmaps
- UI/UX Design: Creating engaging user experiences from concept to implementation

While I enjoy the challenges of full-stack development, my true passion lies in frontend development, where I strive to create impactful user experiences that make a difference.

Let's connect and build something amazing together!
